# spectrogram-to-album-art
A script that generates a spectrogram of each audio file in a directory, then sets the album art to the spectrogram of the associated file.

Script file leverages a [custom build](http://jdesbonnet.blogspot.com/2014/02/sox-spectrogram-log-frequency-axis-and.html) of [sox](http://sox.sourceforge.net/sox.html) to generate spectrogram of file.
